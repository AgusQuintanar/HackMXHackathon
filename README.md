## What is HackMx?

A Hackathon is a 32-hour development and innovation marathon, where multidisciplinary teams solve challenges that require their skills. In turn, it is sought that within the established time a unique service or product is developed using technology. The best projects are rewarded and supported to make them a reality.

HackMx is the Student Hackathon organized by the Tecnológico de Monterrey Region of Mexico City and its headquarters are the three campuses of the institution. This event is organized by students and academics from all the campuses of the region.

## Challenge: Creating solutions against Phishing


**Company:** Banorte

**Difficulty:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Objective:** Use technology to avoid the impact of phishing on end users and prevent theft or digital fraud

**Technologies:** To the team's consideration.

**Essential elements:** Demo / Prototype

**Description:** Currently the Financial Institutions are in constant attack by Ciber Offenders who generate missing sites (Phishing) with the objective of using them to steal information from clients. To have an agile capacity for their identification, and lowers by part of the banks, it is crucial to avoid the impact towards end users and prevent theft or digital fraud.

Phishing is a social engineering technique used by criminals to obtain confidential information such as user names, passwords and credit card details by posing as a reliable and legitimate entity.
The Phishing scenario is usually associated with the ability to duplicate a web page to make the visitor believe that it is on the legitimate website. The deception is usually carried out through email and often these emails contain links to a fake website that looks almost identical to a legitimate site. Through the site, unsuspecting users are tricked into entering confidential data, which gives criminals ample scope to carry out scams and fraud with the information obtained.
The main way to carry out the deception is through sending spam (spam) and inviting the user to access the decoy page. The purpose of the deception is to acquire confidential user information such as passwords, credit cards or financial and banking data.
Some of the most common features of this type of email are:

Use of names of existing companies. Instead of creating the website of a fictitious company from scratch, emails with fraudulent intentions adopt the corporate image and functionality of the website of an existing company, in order to further confuse the recipient of the message.
Use the name of a real employee of a company known as a sender of fake mail. In this way, if the recipient tries to confirm the veracity of the mail by calling the company, they can confirm that the person speaking on behalf of the company works on it.
Web addresses with the correct appearance. As we have seen, fraudulent mail often leads the reader to websites that replicate the aspect of the company that is being used to steal the information. In fact, both the content and the web address (URL) are false and are limited to mimic real content. Even legal information and other non-vital links can redirect the unsuspecting user to the actual web page.
Fear factor. The window of opportunity for fraudsters is very short, since once the company is informed that its customers are being subjected to this type of practice, the server that hosts the fraudulent website and serves to collect information is closed in the interval of a few days, therefore, it is fundamental for the fraudster to get an immediate response from the user. In many cases, the best incentive is to threaten a loss, either economic or from the existing account itself, if the instructions indicated in the received mail are not followed, and which are usually related to new security measures recommended by the entity.
Generation of a technological proposal where through the use of new technologies such as Machine Learning, DeepLearning, Artificial Intelligence, BlockChain, User Behavior Analysis, etc. a solution design that addresses the problems for identification and prevention of Phishing is proposed.
The participants must generate a prototype in which the main idea of ​​their design is demonstrated and they must accompany it with a presentation in which they explain the characteristics of the proposal and its operation model.
